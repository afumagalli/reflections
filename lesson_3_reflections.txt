When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are especially useful for collaborative projects as they allow all participants to contribute to the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This would be particularly important when many people are working on the same repo. That way you don't break the code running on your local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking allows us to make a copy of a GitHub repository and then make our own changes. We can use this when we don't have permission to change the original repo. Cloning makes a copy of a repo on our local machine. And branching is similar to forking but only happens in one repo.
