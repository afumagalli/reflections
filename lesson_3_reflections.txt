When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are especially useful for collaborative projects as they allow all participants to contribute to the project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This would be particularly important when many people are working on the same repo. That way you don't break the code running on your local machine.
