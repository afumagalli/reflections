What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you create a .git file in the directory. This tells the file system to treat the directory as a git repo and not a regular directory. However, it does not make a git commit so that must be done manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a but of an "intermediate" between the working directory and the repository. It allows us to separate between items in our working directory and items we want to commit to git.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using the staging area we can add only the code we want to commit. Using git diff --staged we can compare the staging area to our git repo to see the changes we are about to commit.
